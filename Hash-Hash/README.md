# Hash Sort By Value

You have datastructure 
```perl
my $users = [
    {
        name  => 'John',
        score => 10,
    },
    {
        name  => 'Bob',
        score => 1,
    },
    {
        name  => 'Carlos',
        score => 5
    },
    {
        name  => 'Alice',
        score => 5,
    },
    {
        name  => 'Donald',
        score => 7
    }
]; 
```
Now you have to arrange the name with highest to lower score, if score is same than in alphabetical order 

Expected output: 

John 

Donald 

Alice 

Carlos 

Bob
